A century on, it is clear that this collection of humorous, lyrical and delicately evocative tales had a profound influence on children's literature. Rather than idolising childhood, Dream Days is, as Julia Eccleshare says in her introduction, 'a celebration of the imaginative play of children which sets them apart from adults and empowers them at a time when, within the realities of their lives, they are largely powerless'.\\nIn 'The Twenty-first of October', Selina, a devoted admirer of Nelson, attempts to celebrate Trafalgar Day by lighting a bonfire - with disastrous consequences. In 'The Walls Were as of Jasper' the child-narrator escapes a dull visit to a neighbour's house by losing himself in the pictures of a beautiful book: 'Pictures never lied, never shuffled nor evaded; and as for the story, I could invent it myself '. 'The Reluctant Dragon' tells of the friendship between a little boy and a gentle, poetry-writing dragon, who has made his home in the Berkshire Downs and is blissfully unaware of the alarm his presence has caused in the local village. It is up to the little boy to make sure that the imminent arrival of St George does not spell destruction for his new friend.\\nDream Days is written from the point of view of an adult looking back, and captures the frustrations of children faced by adults who have 'forgotten what it is like to be young'. Whether playing at pirates, inventing imaginary realms, visiting the circus or simply squabbling ferociously among themselves, the five children are vividly and convincingly portrayed.

Such a book, we submit, is Old Yeller; to read this eloquently simple story of a boy and his dog in the Texas hill country is an unforgettable and deeply moving experience.\\nThe big, ugly, yellow dog showed up out of nowhere one night and stole a whole side of hanging pork, and when Travis went for him the next morning that dog started yelling like a baby before he was touched. Then he got into the spring water with five-year-old Arliss, Travis took an easy hate to Old Yeller, as they started to call him; in fact, he would have driven him off or killed him if it hadn't been for brother Arliss' loud and violent protests, So Yeller stayed, and Travis soon found he couldn't have got along without him.\\nPa and Ma and Travis and Arliss lived on Birdsong Creek in the Texas hill country. It wasn't an easy life, but they had a snug cabin that Pa had built himself, and they had their own hogs and their own cattle, and they grew most of what else they needed. The only thing they and the rest of the settlers lacked that year in the late 1860's was cash, so the men decided to get together and drive all the cattle up to the new market in Abilene, Kansas, more than six hundred miles away.\\nTravis was only fourteen, but he was proud of his new role as man of the family and determined to live up to his responsibility. It was hard work, too, plowing until his legs ached, chopping wood until his hands were raw and his head was spinning, weeding the garden in the hot sun, toting the heavy buckets tip from the spring, and trying to keep his mischievous little brother in line.\\nBut there were pleasant moments, too: his Ma treating him like a man, and deer hunting in the early-morning stillness, and hot summer nights out in the corn patch under the stars with Old Yeller, trying to keep the coons and skunks out of the winter food supply. And there was plenty of excitement, like the fight between the two bulls, and the time Arliss nearly got mauled by the bear, and trying to catch and mark the new hogs. Here the suspense and excitement reach a peak, only to be topped a few pages later when the crazy-sick loafer wolf goes for Ma. Both times it is Yeller who saves them, only the second time it is not lucky for Yeller, as Travis comes to find out. And in finding out, Travis learns just how much he has come to love that big ugly dog, and he learns something about the pain of life, too.\\nOld Yeller is a story that will be read and treasured by many thousands for years to come.

The novel follows Alice down a rabbit-hole and into a surreal world of strange and wonderful characters who constantly turn everything upside-down with their mind-boggling logic and word play, and their fantastic parodies. Carroll's fable illustrates his masterful ability to weave logic with nonsense in a tale that continues to delight all ages.While this great classic is widely available, the Broadview edition is unique. Richard Kelly combines Alice's Adventures in Wonderland not with the later (and largely distinct) work Through the Looking Glass but rather with Alice's Adventures Under Ground, Lewis Carroll's first version of the story. Readers are thus able to trace the literary revisions, and to compare Caroll's own illustrations in the original with the famous John Tenniel illustrations for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

Millard offers young readers moving insights into the business of being family, and how 'belonging' can be a wide and generous experience. Neatly sidestepping overt sentimentality, much of the charm of this work lies in the gentleness and goodness inherent in the people who inhabit the book' - WA Premier's Literary Award judges, 2008 'together the individual characters in this story nurture and encourage each other, revealing a heart-warming picture of how delightfully rewarding fostering can be for all concerned. this third book in the Kingdom of Silk series is as engaging as the first two titles. Like the previous stories, it is wonderfully written and can be read as a stand-alone book which is not always the case for books in a series.
